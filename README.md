# Stream Gatherers

Gatherers is a new and powerful API that enhances the Stream API by modeling intermediate operations and allowing the definition of custom intermediate operations. A gatherer supports the features that intermediate operations have, it can push any number of elements to the resulting stream, maintain an internal mutable state, short-circuit a stream, delay consumption, be chained, and execute in parallel.
